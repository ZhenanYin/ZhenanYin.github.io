I am a PhD student in Health and Biomedical Informatics at Indiana University Indianapolis, advised by [Dr. Saptarshi Purkayastha](https://luddy.indianapolis.iu.edu/about/directory/saptarshi-purkayastha.html).

My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare, with a focus on multimodal learning, medical signal processing, and explainable/trustworthy medical AI.

Prior to my PhD studies, I spent five years as a project manager in the healthcare informatics division of [China Mobile Yunnan](https://www.chinamobileltd.com/sc/global/home.php), where I led large-scale digital health initiatives. This experience strengthened my understanding of real-world healthcare challenges and inspired me to pursue research in data-driven health innovation.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), with a concentration in machine learning and controls. During my time at UCSD, I was a research assistant in the [Statistical Visual Computing Lab (SVCL)](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Nuno Vasconcelos](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/people/profile/nuno-vasconcelos), where I worked on developing a deep learning-based plankton image labeling and retrieval system. I also conducted research on a conformal ultrasonic device under the guidance of [Prof. Sheng Xu](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/people/profile/sheng-xu) in [Xu Research Group](https://xugroup.eng.ucsd.edu/).

Drawing from my background in engineering and healthcare, I strive to develop healthcare AI systems that bridge data and clinical understanding, enabling more transparent and reliable medical insights.
