### Overview

Developed a soft, skin-conformal ultrasonic patch for continuous, non-invasive monitoring of central blood pressure and deep-tissue hemodynamics. The device maintains signal integrity during natural body motion, enabling real-time cardiovascular monitoring outside clinical settings.

**Wang C, Li X, Hu H, Zhang L, Huang Z, Lin M, Zhang Z, Yin Z**, Huang B, Gong H, et al. *Monitoring of the central blood pressure waveform via a conformal ultrasonic device.* **Nature Biomedical Engineering**, 2018;2(9):687-695. doi: [10.1038/s41551-018-0287-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-018-0287-x)

### Key Innovation

**Challenge**: Conventional blood pressure monitoring is intermittent (cuff-based) or invasive (catheter-based), failing to capture dynamic cardiovascular changes in real-world conditions.

**Solution**: A stretchable ultrasound transducer that conforms to curved body surfaces (neck, chest) and maintains acoustic coupling during motion.

### Technical Features

#### Device Architecture
- **Stretchable circuitry**: Copper-polyimide flexible electrodes
- **Soft substrate**: Elastomeric material for skin conformability
- **Piezoelectric transducer**: Laser micro-cut for precision
- **Biocompatible encapsulation**: Silicone-based protective layer

#### Key Capabilities
- Continuous arterial pulse monitoring
- Central blood pressure waveform reconstruction
- Maintains performance during body motion
- Non-invasive deep-tissue imaging

### Validation Results

#### Clinical Accuracy
- Successfully measured carotid artery and internal jugular vein pulsations
- Waveform quality comparable to rigid clinical ultrasound probes
- Stable acoustic coupling under dynamic conditions

#### Performance Metrics
- High-fidelity hemodynamic waveforms
- Accurate pulse transit time measurements
- Reliable long-term monitoring capability

### Clinical Significance

Central blood pressure (at the aorta) is a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than peripheral measurements (arm cuff). This device enables:
- **Continuous monitoring** of cardiovascular health
- **Early detection** of hemodynamic changes
- **Home-based** cardiovascular assessment
- **Personalized medicine** through real-time data

### Fabrication Process

1. **Circuit patterning**: Stretchable copper-polyimide networks
2. **Laser micro-cutting**: Precision electrode fabrication
3. **Transducer integration**: Piezoelectric element embedding
4. **Elastomer encapsulation**: Soft protective coating
5. **Acoustic optimization**: Maintained signal transparency

### Applications

This wearable ultrasound technology enables:
- Continuous cardiovascular monitoring for at-risk patients
- Real-time hemodynamic assessment during exercise
- Home-based health tracking for chronic conditions
- Early warning system for cardiovascular events

### Impact

This work represents a transformative step toward **wearable clinical-grade medical devices**, combining:
- Soft materials engineering
- Biocompatible electronics
- Advanced ultrasound imaging
- Continuous health monitoring
